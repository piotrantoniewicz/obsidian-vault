### Wprowadzenie do Amira

**0:00** · You've actually set up these independent, fully loaded brains in Claude and Chat GPT and then use those to hold the context for you and be more efficient with your job. So, show us what one of these brains actually looks like.

**0:14** · Yeah, let's dive right into it. So, here's an example of a project. You can see here that I have a bunch of them.

**0:21** · And in it, we have my files and my instructions. Right now, there's 20 files. It started with two or three or four and then just kept growing and growing in terms of its pre. This is what all the projects look like. They all just have a lot of files, instructions and you can see my endless amount of threads that I have with it.

**0:37** · Okay. So, what do you think are important files for a product manager to put in?

**0:42** · So, I usually kick it off with a ping pong. So, I give it any data that I have. If there is anything that references as to what exactly is going on to start things off, then it helps me and the thread that I'm having here in projects get an understanding as to what I'm looking to achieve and more realistic what we're talking about.

**1:00** · \[Music\] Welcome back to how I AI. I'm Clarvo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today I have AI PM Amir Klein who works at monday.com and is in the top five AI powered PMs on his team.

**1:19** · He's going to show us how he uses AI to build scrapers to get customer feedback into his custom GPTs, use those custom GPTs to not only make his product sense better, but improve feedback that he's gotten from his boss. And finally, he is the first guest that will demo Voice Mode live for us on air to show how he prepares for product interviews. Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by GoFundMe giving funds, the zero fee daff.

**1:47** · I want to tell you about a new product GoFundMe has launched called Giving Funds. A smarter, easier way to give, especially during tax season, which is basically here. GoFundMe giving funds is the DAFF or donor advice fund from the world's number one giving platform trusted by 200 million people.

**2:07** · It's basically your own mini foundation without the lawyers or admin costs. You contribute money or appreciated assets, get the tax deduction right away, potentially reduce capital gains, and then decide later where to donate from 1.4 million nonprofits. There are zero admin or asset fees. And while the money sits there, you can invest and grow it tax-free, so you have more to give later. All from one simple hub with one clean tax receipt.

**2:35** · Lock in your deduction now and decide where to give later. Perfect for tax season. Join the GoFundMe community of 200 million and start saving money on your tax bill, all while helping the causes you care about the most. Start your giving fund today in just minutes at gofundme.com/howi ai. We'll even cover the daff pay fees if you transfer your existing daff over. That's gofundme.com/howi ai to start your giving fund. Hey Omir, happy to have you here.

### Wykorzystanie niestandardowych folderów projektu GPT jako „drugiego mózgu”

**3:14** · Thank you Claire. Happy to be here. So, one of the reasons why I'm excited to have you here is you don't just like using AI. We were just talking about it. You are now highly dependent and maybe incapable of doing your job without AI. So, tell me how you got to this point where you're really depending on AI to do your job as an AI PM.

**3:37** · Yeah, I think there's like the whole context switching um is something that's really difficult for everyone. And as a PM, when you're going back toback meetings and jumping between different initiatives and different requirements and asks from people, you have so many things to juggle that I discovered with the help of everything that's out there online that you can silo like brains of conversations and threads in GPT and cloud that it made me super dependent on it in order to just do my work. And I'm doing it really well.

**4:07** · I think I'm doing really efficiently. So that's how I got to where I am today.

**4:13** · Okay.

**4:13** · So what you're saying is you like all PMs have to context switch and hold a million different threads in your mind at one time. And instead of burdening your poor human brain with all that contact switching, you've actually set up these like independent fully loaded brains in Claude and chat GBT and then use those to hold the context for you and be more efficient with your job.

**4:40** · Absolutely.

**4:40** · Now, okay. So, show us what one of these brains actually looks like. What are some of the use cases for my collection my file folder of of brains? Yeah, let's dive right into it. Um, so I'm going to I guess dive into what a I guess folder looks like, my projects look like.

**5:01** · So here's an example of um a project.

**5:04** · You can see here that I have a bunch of them. And in it, we have like my files and my instructions. Um, so right now there's 20 files. It started with two or three or four and then just kept growing and growing in terms of its brain. And I'll dive into like some of the files that are in here and kind of like what I'm trying to achieve to help you understand like how I put this into action, but just this is what all the projects look like. They all just have a lot of files, instructions, and you can see like my endless amount of threads that I have with it um like non-stop.

**5:37** · Okay.

**5:37** · So what do you think are important files for a product manager to put in or what are some unique sources of you know context for these GPT projects that you have found particularly useful or unique?

**5:50** · It varies obviously on what you're working on but I always start with some sort of like reference that it can understand whatever is that I'm starting with. So I usually kick it off with a ping pong. So I give it any data that I have any data whatsoever. So, if there's a company kickoff deck, if there's a team kickoff deck, if there's another reference to a PR, if there is anything that um references as to what exactly is

**6:13** · going on to start things off, then it helps like me and the thread that I'm having here in projects get an understanding as to what I'm looking to achieve and more what we're talking about.

### Tworzenie scrapera Reddita z pomocą Claude'a

**6:25** · Great. And then what do you want these, you know, second brains or these GPTs to actually do for you? So, what is the, you know, what does this one actually do for you?

**6:35** · I'll start this one kind of like where it began. Um, I started at my company at monday.com leading like the AI agents uh team, the whole initiative there. And I'm sure anyone who's on AI today can allude to the fact that AI agents is probably like one of the most fantasized thing that is in SAS. Everybody wants it. Everybody wants it to work.

**6:59** · Everybody has like this vision of what it can do and it can do everything and whatever you hear outside is also what you hear inside. And there's a thousand different voices and different opinions of where they want it to go and what they believe it will be. And I was seeking some voice of reason that was unbiased. I was looking for conversations that people were having that weren't connected to my company that didn't have any specific narrative they wanted to go down. I just wanted to know what people are interested in, what they expect, and what they want.

**7:30** · Um, which is what led me to Reddit.

**7:34** · Okay.

**7:34** · So, you were a PM. You were given the great and wonderful task of building out agents. No one has agreed on what the definition of an agent is. No one has agreed what the agent should do. No one really understands if customers actually even want agents. Technically there's a lot of complexity and um aspirationally there's a lot of goals around these.

**7:56** · So this is a very common product manager problem where you're given a big meaty interesting technically complex problem with a lot of hopes and dreams in it and then it's your job to go make it reality. And so what I'm hearing from you is you went and sought out these different resources um that were external that could give you more of an unbiased filter on which to make some product decisions and maybe

**8:21** · even go kind of back to your leadership partners or people with big hopes and dreams and say this is what people actually want or this is what's actually possible. And so you mentioned Reddit.

**8:31** · What did you actually pull from Reddit that you think was so useful here? So, I'm going to walk you through like what I did here in order to scrape conversations on Reddit uh with the help of Claude. I had this idea. I had this vision that I'm going to be able to get this file or many files containing thousands and thousands of conversations that people have about anything that I wanted. In this case, I wanted about agents, AI, money.com, all in relation with one another. Um, so I went into I went into uh to cloud and I said, "Here, help me help me scrape conversations."

**9:03** · I started my conversation here with just like I want to find everything that's written aboutmoney.com whether it be on Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, anything that's online. Um, and I wanted like a sort of an automated free way to do this. So, it went into like a bunch of different options. We realized that LinkedIn and Twitter have like more limited APIs. Some of them are like paid. Eventually, we got down to what I needed, how to get it, and how can do it more automated. So, I asked, "Okay, great. We know Reddit is the place I need to be. Now, give me a step-by-step guide of what I need to do."

**9:33** · So, I'm not not technical. I am a little bit I have a little bit of experience with things.

**9:39** · Um, but I want to make sure I'm not skipping any steps. I want to make sure that everything I'm doing here is going to be exactly what needs to be done because I had a vision of what I'm getting out of this here. So, it literally walks me through here like open Safari, go to Brew, write a command, open your terminal, write like literally step by step of what I need to do as if I'm 5 years old and I don't know how to uh program or code anything, which was fantastic. It tells me to go into Reddit, go into this, make make a a developer account. I literally follow the step by step. I didn't even try changing any name. I literally did as as it asked.

**10:10** · And then we get to, you know, doing brew install. It's getting stuck, whatever. Eventually, we get to the good stuff where I have everything set up.

**10:19** · Um, it's finished. Now, what do I do? I had the environment set up and I had all the packages that I need to set up. And now it starts giving me like all these commands to run. So install different packages and libraries that I need in order to run the script that I write for me. Here's a script that I'm going to help you write and let's get started. So basically it writes me up this script we can see over here where it I put in my client ID would ask me to take out from Reddit my client secret and my username.

**10:47** · Um and then it scrapes everything that has to do with like Monday with things that I'm looking for with AI and whatever it be. Um, and lo and behold, came out a file with 34,000 rows of conversations.

### Analiza 34 000 wierszy rozmów na Reddicie

**11:03** · Okay.

**11:03** · So, you had this like very again a very classic product manager problem of I know people are talking about this product. Like I I know I know there's information out there and I can manually call through and you know do Reddit searches and search through Twitter, but I want to do this in a programmatic way.

**11:20** · I'm technical but not that technical and dear God I don't want to write a bunch of Python. And so what you did is you went to Claude and you said, "I have this general problem. I just want to know what's out there." You actually said the prompt is really interesting. It says, "I want to know everything out there." Everything everyone is saying. That's a very broad ambition.

**11:36** · Yeah. Very ambitious flow.

**11:39** · And then, you know, Claude narrowed you into, well, here are the actual accessible sources of data for you. And then you wrote a script to go pull all that Reddit data. And then what did you do with that? Yeah, you said 34,000 or something. 3,400 um line spreadsheet.

**11:58** · What did what did you do with that data?

**12:01** · Um so I'll show you basically first of all I want to show you what the file looks like just so you get a glimpse as to what this like monstrous file is. So this is what 34,000 rows of threads looks like um in relation to the conversations that I wanted, the theme that I was looking for. So this is great. Um, and it really helps me understand. I get a lot of conversations. I also went crazy with it. I said like, "Give me different files. Show me how it looks like in compar in terms of our competitors.

**12:26** · Show me conversations that are happening like in relation to our competitors like comparing us to any other competitor and their AI and give me some sort of idea." When I had all that information, I went back into Claude and I said, "Okay, now be my analyst." Um, and start breaking this down. I'm like really into data.

**12:46** · Um, I have like a little bit of a a data background. So, I came into it and I said, "Here, I'm giving you this this file. This is one of the files that was pulled out with 30,000 rows of conversations." And I said, "I want you to summarize it in a table where you put like the frequency." So, how often it comes up at what percentage.

**13:03** · I need weights because I need numbers to go back to my team and for myself to know what to prioritize, see what the biggest hottest topics are that people are are discussing and some of the key discussion points. and out comes this table which is really nice and really helpful because I have okay here's here's a here's some sort of idea I know like what are the top five areas

**13:24** · that people are wishing and hoping and having conversations about around this their expectation and their dreams around what AI or an agent would do and did you find that this did you spot check this at all did you just trust it did you feel like this was relatively accurate based on what you saw in that in that spreadsheet yeah it's a really good question um I did check it obviously I'm not checking 34 4,000 rows of conversations. But um I did do like keyword searches and I looked at different threads and conversations that I pulled up.

**13:49** · Also what I typically do with whenever I ask GBT or Claude to analyze something, I say reference, give me at least one or two quotes as to where this came up from and I have tons of conversations where it does that. So then I fact check it. I copy that. I go back into document and make sure that it's actually there.

### Jak budować efektywne, niestandardowe bazy wiedzy GPT

**14:07** · Awesome. And so you built this scraper, you took the data, you analyzed it. Did you then feed this analysis back into that GPT project we saw before? Kind of how does this become part of your corpus of one of your secondary brains?

**14:23** · Yeah, fantastic. So I'll show you um how that looks like back in the project itself. So here I am in the project. Um, you can see that I have like the thread like the AI threads on Reddit and in general like these are different like Reddit th files that I had and this is how I started things off.

**14:40** · I had my kickoff that I had um that my manager did and I had a couple of pages that like I took from our site of like how Monday works and I just command Ped it so it's a PDF and put in another classic example of everything is text and then it so it has an idea. It knows what Monday is. in know what in more or less like what our goal is as a team and here are some conversations that are happening so you have some sort of idea as to what people's dreams and hopes are when it comes to AI.

**15:07** · Yeah, I just want to call out that little trick for folks that may might have missed it because I do the exact same thing, which is I actually just use our marketing website or our support website and I just print things as PDFs and download them and then upload them to GPT projects or whatever kind of store because then I know it's scoped to that specific piece of content. I've done it a lot with like support pages. I've done it with the homepage obviously because that's usually like the source of truth of your your positioning. And then I do it a lot with like pricing pages.

**15:34** · So, I'll go like print a bunch of competitor pricing pages and drop them in a GPT. So, I think that's a really great source of information for a GPT.

**15:44** · No, for sure. I think like once you like when I started with this and I had the CSV file from from um Reddit, my mind was like, okay, literally everything is text. So, like even you may not necessarily think of like a slide. It was a slide from like Google Slides as like text, but it is. So you just download as a PDF and you have just like whatever it is, however many slides here as a reference. Um and like the example that you said as well like the list is endless of what is text.

**16:16** · So I have it all through like instructions more or less of like what I want to do.

**16:22** · Uh make sure that it is a professional in product management and expert and all this stuff. It has a good product strategy mindset and product sense mindset. Um, I also gave it like a lot of like instructions on, you know, you know, how to give feedback to me, you know, how to give candid feedback and you're not going to be like too nice to me, you know, to challenge because I hate it when the AI will be like super supportive of every idea that I come up with. Like push back on things.

**16:46** · You have the knowledge, so feel free to challenge me on things that I come up with and then the ping pong begins and then we start going back and forth and I have a thousands of conversations here.

**16:55** · And so are you using this as a thought partner? Are you using this to prep for meetings with your boss? Like what are the most common use cases for this GBT for you?

**17:04** · All my projects I start with a scope. I want to get to some sort of like outline overview that will help me with PPRD with a product review with some something that I can deliver to my team.

**17:14** · So narrative. So it always starts off with a ping pong always. And then once I've gone into some sort of document and I have like this overview doc of what it is, I played around with it. I download it and I put it back into its knowledge.

**17:27** · And now it has that as a basis and then it goes from there. The more work I do with it, the more knowledge I add into it uh into its files. And then everything that comes after that is just super intuitive and fluid. I'll give you examples like if I need to write something, how often I get asked questions by like marketing and with the communications theme of like, okay, you're releasing something. Can you give me like a twoline sentence is what it is. Those are classic examples of like catch me in the middle of the day on Slack and ask me then. I'm I don't know.

**17:56** · I don't have the capacity to think about that, but here is something that has a brain for this. I ask it that question and it usually does a pretty good job and then lo and behold, here we go.

### Tworzenie spersonalizowanego trenera pisania z biuletynu Lenny'ego

**18:05** · Great. And then, you know, speaking of documents, I think one of the common complaints that, you know, people have about AI generated documents is the writing maybe isn't great. And at the very least, maybe it's good thinking, but it's quite long. And I know you've also built a custom GBT to make sure that your writing is concise. So, can you show us a little bit of what that looks like?

**18:28** · Yeah, there's al also a background to that. Um, so if any of my past managers and colleagues see this, um, they will be able to confirm this, but I've been giving feedback multiple times and my writing is good, but it can be really long. So, my Slack messages on updates and channels are really long and it's hard for people to get through. And Lenny released I think there was a newsletter where you had Wescow like say more or less like her recommendations on how to write concisely, how to deliver message well.

**18:58** · And again example here of everything is written. Um I took these newsletters, I command Ped it, downloaded them and I put it into a custom GPT as like my guidelines to how to write. Um and I'll show you what this custom GPT looks like.

**19:14** · You've seen the doom and gloom headlines. AI is coming for your job. But the reality is a little bit brighter. In Miro's latest survey, 76% of people say AI can boost their work.

**19:26** · It's just that 54% still don't know when to use it. As a product leader and a solo founder, I live or die by how fast I can turn fuzzy ideas into crisp value propositions, road maps, and launch plans. That's why I love Miro's innovation workspace. It drops an AI co-pilot inside the canvas so stickies, screenshots, and brainstorm bullets can become usable diagrams, product briefs, and even prototypes in minutes. Your team can dive in, riff, and iterate.

**19:56** · And because the board feels like a digital playground, everyone has fun while you cut cycle time by a third. Miro lets humans and AI play to their strengths so that great ideas ship faster and happier. Help your teams get great done with Miro. Check out miro.com to find out how. That's mirror o.com.

**20:23** · So, while you're pulling that up, I have to ask, did you try Lennybot yet?

**20:27** · Because I I know he has his own bot with all of these newsletters and some content loaded in, but you wanted something really precise, right? So, you created your own. I had something really spec specific because I know what it is that I needed. Um, so I took in her newsletters because he hosted her on on his podcast. She also referenced a bunch of books. I looked for those books online and put them in here. I never read them, but I just put them in here. It's like, okay, you must know then how writing and delivering is.

**20:58** · And then you have this here this this instructions that like this GPT rewrites Slack messages to be more concise to be more clear to be readable maintains the natural voice of the user because I want anyone in my company anyone in general to use this GPT so it doesn't like make it super AI like I said here as well like you know avoid too much dashes don't give so much

**21:19** · bullet points all those stuff like that and then I come into here so often I'll write a message out on Slack to like myself I'll copy it paste it in and it does a really good job of making it super concise, sticking to these guidelines of like delivering to the point, having really good followup and leadup as to what the next section will be. It is a lifesaver. People respond to my Slack messages more now.

**21:42** · So, I know that you didn't read the books, but I do have to recommend as somebody with a liberal arts degree, those are exceptional books on writing. So, I highly recommend reading them.

**21:50** · We'll link to them and the newsletter and Wes's website in the show notes. But what I love about the approach here is a lot of times people get sort of professional development feedback like you got your writing's great it just needs to be shorter like you just write too much and a lot of people don't really build for themselves a way to coach into improving those skills right

### Wykorzystanie sztucznej inteligencji do rozwoju zawodowego i informacji zwrotnej

**22:16** · they're like thanks for the feedback but I'm not going to sit with my boss for an hour and have them like edit my Slack messages and edit my PRDS uh maybe I'll read a book or maybe I can do some research, but it's it's a hard thing to put into practice into your day-to-day.

**22:30** · And so what I like about this is you took some coaching feedback that you got and you're like, cool, I'm going to create myself a coach for this very specific development piece that I need to work on and I'm going to rely on experts that I think are great and then I'm going to use it dayto day to actually make things better. Sure. And then what I liked again about what you said is and then I'm going to share it with with my colleagues because I'm sure I'm not the only one that has has this problem. So I think it's a really yeah really nice process.

**23:00** · And I think it's really cool that you mentioned like all that like I'm not going to know send this and have like somebody rewrite it like go pre GBT era and my dependency on AI. I did that. I got this feedback. I'm all for feedback.

**23:12** · I love feedback and I love improving anything on stuff like that. I would literally do that. I would write out a message to myself, send it to my manager and say, "Hey, tell me how this can be improved." And he wouldn't respond. He came back a couple days later. By then, like, I lost momentum. That's what I wanted to say. And then this is a game changer for me. And yeah, I definitely think other people probably feel it as well.

**23:32** · Well, and it makes me think of another idea that maybe folks would find useful, which is, you know, people get performance reviews on maybe an annual or twice annual basis. Like, what do you do with that? And you know, maybe what you do is you load up your performance review and you load up your peer feedback into a GPT and you reference it and you say, "Hey, I just made this stock, but based on the feedback that I've gotten in the past, is there any like blind spots that I might have?" I think it's a really great method for self-reflection and self-improvement if you're, you know, if you're open to feedback like it seems like you are.

**24:04** · Yeah, absolutely. The the it's limitless what you can do.

### Przygotowanie do rozmów kwalifikacyjnych z produktami z wykorzystaniem trybu głosowego GPT

**24:09** · Okay. So for our last use case, you know, you seem like a person that likes a lot of feedback and likes to prep. You actually use GPT voice for mock interviews and we are going to push the bounds of the technical capabilities of this podcast and see if we can demo this. So while we're getting set up, can you tell us a little bit about the problem you were trying to solve and what why you kind of went down this path?

**24:34** · Yeah.

**24:34** · Okay. So basically anyone who's prepping for interviews for for product interviews knows that there is a lot of content out there. Uh YouTube is loaded with mock interviews. Exponent is a fantastic channel. Um there's a lot of different people I could shout out, but I'm not going to off top my head. I haven't been interviewed for in for a job in a while. But basically interview prep, what I would do, and I think a bunch of people would do leading up to product interviews was watch these videos um over and over again. I'm obsessive.

**25:01** · I would watch the same three videos over and over and over again, remember any nuance and stuff like that that when I walked into an interview, it was like copy paste of what I just listened to and I would feel super awkward to be like, let me practice on something. I tried in front of a mirror, it didn't work. My mirror is not talking back to me. I tried with my wife and I was like, hey, these are the type of things to ask me. She didn't know what I wanted from her. So when GBT voice came out, I'm like, I'm going to do this.

**25:28** · I will be that lunatic in my living room talking to AI as if we're in the movie Her. And it was like the most exciting thing ever. Like I forgot that I'm talking to AI. I feel like I have this like this interview coach who's with me at all times, who's constantly like challenging me and pushing me and like finding the right things, coming up fantastic questions, and I'm like, "This is what I needed." And I walked into every interview after that super prepared. It was the best feeling ever.

**25:57** · Literally can't recommend it more. anytime anybody asks me like how to prepare for a product uh interview, I said just open GPD voice and just go for it.

**26:06** · Okay.

**26:06** · So, I have to ask because you have this very structured setup from, you know, a writing GPT perspective and a product GPT perspective, but it sounds like you're just opening up GPT voice and and going for it. Are there any tricks to getting GPT voice into the right mindset? And then once you tell us, let's try it. Let's try it live. Let's see if we can make it happen. I'm gonna make you feel so awkward.

**26:31** · Let's We could We could definitely do it. Um I'm going to be super rusty. Um there's first of all, there's two different approaches. Yes, I am organized and structured, but I do love to freestyle it. I did make a custom GPT for something like this. Um I can show it to you so you have an idea of what it is.

**26:49** · But basically like so similar to the other one, it has like instructions on like what product sense questions like you need to look out for and what product execution questions you need to look out for and like for instance the the interview the interviewer needs to clarify the company's mission and the product goals and identify specific target users and pinpoint their real pain points then design a solution that solve those pain points and then they all have a sequence to it. So I want to make sure that it understood like what exactly you need to look out for and what type of things you need to ask.

**27:21** · And then obviously I put in some knowledge base to it too. I have my own product manager interview prep document. I took Ben Harris's uh posts. He's fantastic on product coaching um on product sense and product execution. And now it has this whole background. You can pop into this GPT and have a conversation with it. Um, and it's super guided on what a product sense interview looks like, what a product execution interview looks like.

**27:47** · So, that's like more structured. You can use the voice mode and go for it. Um, freestyling, we can chat to freestyle. Let's do that. I'll open my trade style.

**27:56** · One other thing that I would add, you can also plop in your CV and the link to the uh role that you're applying for. So, there's more context as to who you are and what they're looking for in the role itself. And then there's more of like guidance towards things to pick on.

**28:08** · But you can freestyle it. And also like if you have like in backtoback if you have backto-back interviews with like GBT voice, it can learn from like what you made mistakes on beforehand. Like I was really bad at user segments. I always struggle with it. And then like I would be like, "Okay, now let's let's talk through this and figure it out."

**28:25** · And then the next two interviews like, "Oh, you're your um user segment actually has improved. You really figured out how to like narrow down different user segments that are super different." So anyways, uh great.

**28:36** · Let's get started. Okay, let's try. For those that are listening, not watching, I've made Amir very uncomfortable by making him talk to AI.

**28:46** · What's that? Can you can you hear me?

**28:48** · Like everything's working fine on my end. How can I help you today?

**28:52** · So, I want you um to interview me um for a Product Sense interview. I'm interviewing for a role at monday.com as an AI product manager. Um and I need you to give me a Product Sense question.

**29:05** · It's really important that you don't guide me in anything that you are super candid that you let me take the reins on where I take this interview and in terms of like the direction um don't lead me to anything. Don't be um specific or give me any hints. Um and at the end of it, give me some candid feedback. Let me know if that makes sense to you.

**29:27** · That makes perfect sense. I'm happy to help you prep for your interview. So, let's dive right in. Uh, here's a product sense question for you. Imagine you are tasked with improving the user experience for one of monday.com's AI powered features. How would you go about identifying areas of improvement and what steps would you take to implement those improvements? Uh, feel free to take it in any direction you like.

**29:52** · Claire, I'm going to stop there. I'm not going to do the interview.

**29:55** · No, that's great.

**29:56** · You're like, I don't want people to see if I'm a good or bad PM.

**29:59** · Also, product like we should be doing products all the time, but no. Yeah, if you could have caught me like a couple years ago, I probably would have been able to ace that interview right now.

**30:06** · No, this one's great. I mean, what I think I want to call out for for folks, so thank you for being a good sport that was really really good. For folks listening at home, give a small round of applause for Amir. So, the thing that I want to call out that I think is is really great in your setup is again, you gave it a job like you're going to help me prep for interviews and then we're all so frustrated with how nice AI is.

**30:30** · It's so nice and it wants you to succeed and will sort of craft you into questions that like lead you to the right answer. And I think your caveats that you called out in prepping the voice agent are really important, right?

**30:45** · Like don't lead me to anything. Be super candid. Kind of be objective. Give me a real interview and then finalize with with some feedback. And I think that's really great feedback. The other thing that I want to call out is how natural. It doesn't feel natural to do uh GBT voice mode on a podcast live that you know thousands of people are going to watch. But it does feel natural to speak and practice interviewing with voice.

**31:12** · It's not the same to sit there and type out an answer to a question. And in fact, like your written communication skills are just very different than your verbal communication skills. And so I think the the process if if folks were listening of just how the intonation of the voice, how they ask the questions, how you can interact sort of live, I do think simulates the interview process a lot better than sort of like a textbased GBT would.

**31:40** · No, for sure. I would never do that textbased. Um, absolutely. It's supernatural. It's it's oddly natural.

**31:47** · So 100%.

**31:49** · And then I'm going to call out a couple other, you know, maybe adjacent use cases that people can be inspired by. My my darling husband is one of the people that can prep for public speaking by like going to the bathroom and speaking in the in the mirror. And I can't I can't do it. I I hate I hate looking at myself too much, which is odd to say for for a podcast host. But, you know, just thinking about maybe doing kind of like speech and public speaking prep via voice mode, like where did I do well?

**32:18** · Where did I not do well? Um, and then I'm even thinking for my kids, we're doing a really um we're trying to do a consistent job of getting them to read out loud at night and think about their punctuation and emphasis, all that. And I'm like, "Oh my gosh, my kids should do oral dictation to GPT voice mode and get a little get a little feedback."

**32:40** · Although I love I love our bedtime story time. Do that, you know, totally. The world of AI with kids is unreal. It's unreal. Uh which is, you know, we can go that for hours as well. The stuff that I do with my daughter is so much fun. I think at some point we're going to do a roundt parents in AI episode where we get like half a dozen of us on to talk about all of our tips and tricks. Okay, Amir, this was so great. So just going back to the beginning, what do we cover?

**33:07** · Product GBTs using quad to help you discover and technically implement ways to access customer and market feedback data, do data analysis, and then as you say, create these GBTs as a secondary brain that you can pingpong with, that you can go back and forth with and have a thought partner on.

**33:26** · Um, you taught us how to take feedback well, which is AI aside, a really good trait, but take feedback and then put that feedback from your um, your boss or your peers into a custom GPT that then can coach you and improve something you need to prove on.

**33:43** · For you, it was using um, concise writing tactics. And then the third piece, again, a very feedback oriented person. You prepare for interviews. You want to do a great job. There's a lot of resources out there to prepare for interviews. Well, and so you used GPT voice to do mock interviews and not only do mock interviews, but get ongoing feedback about how you're improving on product sense and products execution interviews. So, you really are dependent or at least a power user of AI.

**34:16** · I love the power user.

**34:18** · I love the power user. I think there's there was um in like my company they really try to reinforce AI to everybody and they did this like top 10 AI powered use you like PMs using AI um since January 2025 my son was born in February so I was on Pat for two months so I was active at the company for four months of this sixmonth range there's 90 PMs there I was number four of power users and I had a twomonth delay on people.

**34:48** · So, I'm consider myself number one or number two.

**34:53** · And I also want to add like a bonus thing, Claire, if that's all right, that your episodes inspired me a lot that I vibe coded um a scraper that can do what I did for anyone. It's in the works. I wish that I finished it up until this point, but basically like the concept is what I wanted, find any discussion anywhere. um where users can kind of just write in their own natural language what they want to scrape from any platform.

**35:18** · So let's say for instance I have like I want every discussion that relates to AI withmoney.com I have hard mentions that like with all the keywords it'll always reference that towards whatever it is I'm searching the platform that I want the the output and then I want to search for it and give me the file. So it's in the works. It's not done yet. I have like the results are okay but when it's out there um I'll share it.

**35:41** · Well, if it's live by the time we uh put this episode out, we will link to that in the show notes or we'll do a follow-up and I'm happy to be a beta user because that looks super useful.

### Krótkie podsumowanie i końcowe przemyślenia

**35:53** · All right, we're going to wrap up with two lightning round questions and get you back to spending time with voice mode. My first question is for PMs that are not on the top of that leaderboard, what do you think the number one thing they're missing out on is? Honestly, it's the ability to be at so many places simultaneously. That's really what it is.

**36:18** · I can be asked on the spot from pretty much anyone in the company about something and I can give you an answer really quickly. I couldn't have done that preai.

**36:29** · Amazing. Uh I I think it's such a great I mean it's you know as a as a leader it's our favorite trait of our favorite PMs is know everything are everywhere at all times. It's really tough as a PM to do that though because of you know just physical limitations, space time, mental capacity, all that kind of stuff. And so, you know, I do recommend these these tools because they just give you a lot of horsepower in terms of answering questions, getting stuff done right away and holding all that context without totally totally breaking your brain.

**37:00** · Okay, last and final question I ask everybody. When AI is not listening and it's giving you bad results or analyzing your data incorrectly, what is your tactic for getting it back on track? Do you bribe it with money?

**37:16** · I just yell. I just yell.

**37:20** · I'm in voice anyways, right? Can you not hear my tone?

**37:24** · You were the first person that's admitted to getting getting angry with AI on this podcast.

**37:30** · So, pre prevoice it was caps. I'll be like, "This is not what I asked for." Um, and now voice, you can you can get upset. Uh, no, but and mostly what I do is I'll copy the response and I'll say, "This isn't what I was looking for. This is an example what I was looking for." Um, that's usually what I do. Um, to just have some sort of benchmark reflection on it.

**37:52** · Amazing. All right. Well, thank you so much for sharing your workflows with us.

**37:56** · Where can we find you and how can we be helpful?

**37:58** · I'm like not too active on social media. I like pop into LinkedIn from time to time, so that's always good. And honestly, anyone who's posting anything cool on what they do with AI is super super helpful. The list of things that I do here, majority of it is just inspiration from what I've seen online. So, keep it up.

**38:17** · Great. Well, you keep it up as well. Thanks for being here.
