## Transcript

### Introducing Yana Welinder and Yana Bana

**0:00** · Normally, I would hire a technical team, like engineers. I didn't, right? I sort of just came to Codex and \[music\] asked it to build the website. The idea is to use AI really anywhere in the process where that makes sense. It's literally my technical co-founder.

**0:15** · There's so much you couldn't do before, practically, from a cost perspective, even from an execution perspective, that is now totally possible. And so, you can like unlock your creativity in a way that wasn't possible before.

**0:29** · does unlock so much creativity. A lot of my designs start from a hand-drawn sketch, but the other piece of this is I sort of developed the fashion prompt that's behind it. And it describes a lot of sort of what goes into garments. So, it has like the the silhouette, uh the proportion or the volume of of the dress, like kind of like the fabric, how it flows, how it behaves, the construction details, how it moves, even how it sounds.

**0:56** · The other piece that is still unsolved, and I'm sort of still banging my head against the wall, is to get it to create patterns based on my design. And there I'm kind of running humans and AI in parallel. So, I I am working with human pattern makers Codex and just saying who's going to get to making my things fastest.

**1:15** · \[music\] Welcome to How I AI. I'm Claire Val, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today I have Yana Welander, and she is building an AI native fashion startup. And she's going to show us how AI can intersect art, creativity, and real-world production, and why computer use plus software means SaaS really isn't dead, at least not yet. Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by Merge. Building an AI product is one thing.

**1:48** · \[music\] The hard part is everything around it. Connecting to the tools your team and customers rely on, letting agents take action with the right permissions and keeping \[music\] everything reliable and cost-efficient once you're in production. Most teams end up piecing that together themselves. So, instead of building the product \[music\] you actually care about, you get pulled into integrations, permissions, routing, and all the infrastructure underneath. Merge is the infrastructure layer for production AI.

**2:15** · It connects to thousands of tools, gives agents secure ways to act inside them, and optimizes model routing and spend without you building or owning any of it. OpenAI, Dropbox, and Ramp already use Merge to move fast and build AI right. Visit merge.dev/howiaai to start building for free. Yana, thanks for joining How AI. I'm an art and fashion girl. You know this. There are like five of us AI art and fashion girls on Twitter.

### Tour of the Yana Bana site

**2:47** · And we all find each other, but I'm one and I love what you're working on. So, immerse us in this new thing that you're working on, and then we'll talk about how you're using AI in this really unique fashion.

**3:00** · Cool. Yeah, I'm so excited to be here. Thanks for having me. I am building this AI-native fashion brand, and the idea is to use AI really anywhere in the process where that makes sense. So, obviously heavily in the design and production process, but also it's literally my technical co-founder, and so I that's that's what I use it for, everything.

**3:26** · And can you show us like it's it's probably hard for people to conceptualize what like an AI-powered fashion brand looks like? Can you just like show us a little bit of kind of like some of the stuff that you're working on, and then we can get into how it actually how you actually got there.

**3:40** · So, this is Yana banana, the the the fashion brand, and you can kind of see like every everything here is built with AI. So, you have some of the different garments that I designed, and I'll show later that's like different ones starts from different like from different inspiration from different points. So often time I start from a sketch. You can see that when you hover over some of these.

**4:04** · So I start with with a hand drawn humanly manually, you know, old school hand drawn sketch and then I use AI to turn that into different types of fashion collateral and kind of technical specs and everything along the line to ultimately get to a garment and I kind of use AI for all the things to visualize it to create photos to create videos of some of these garments.

**4:27** · There a lot of them kind of allude to different like uh technical uh you know, computer things in a lot of ways because I feel like that should be really part of the theme. It should be obvious that that what it comes comes from and so the fabrics will use a lot of kind of the punch card like computer punch card uh patterns and

**4:51** · and things like that so that you can really see that on the other the other way in which it sort of appears so you can see for example for this like uh post keyboard t-shirt which I'm wearing myself right now.

**5:03** · Um it also is uh alluding to the fact that now we are not going to be using keyboards and uh in a lot of this stuff but can we now have like give it a second life essentially and to make sure that it's like obvious the world we live in and the world we're entering.

### The fashion prompt stack

**5:20** · And I just want to pause because when I first saw this I was like what a fun like little art project. Like I once made this like I vibe coded this app which was um Anthropic as an anthropology website cuz I thought it was very funny.

**5:33** · But you're actually bringing these designs to life. Like you are actually wearing this keyboard shirt which is super cool. And so what you know, I hear a lot of people who are in the creative fields be really fearful of AI because I think it is like displacement in a lot of ways. Like let's let's all be honest here. There's like videos and sketching and all sorts of stuff that AI can do.

**5:55** · And yet, if you step on the other side of this like post keyboard future, there's so much you couldn't do before practically from a cost perspective, even from an execution perspective, that is now totally possible. And so you can like unlock your creativity in a way that wasn't possible before.

**6:17** · So, I want you to show us step-by-step kind of what goes into creating a garment like this, creating and imagining a design like this, and then actually getting it to production, and getting a website like this up.

**6:31** · I think I think you're absolutely right that it really does unlock so much creativity. A lot of a lot of my designs start from a hand-drawn sketch, but um the other piece of this is I sort of kind of developed this um uh technical essentially stack, but I've for the purpose of visualizing what it looks like, I have this sort of set up as just like the the the fashion prompt that's behind it. And it describes a lot of sort of what goes into a garment.

**6:59** · So, it has like the the silhouette, uh the proportion or the volume of of the dress, like kind of like the fabric, how how it how it flows, how it behaves, um the the construction details, how it moves, um even how it sounds. And I can I can show in one of the pieces it kind of has this really interesting kind of sound as you're walking in in uh in the dress.

**7:26** · And I take all of this and put it together in in essentially kind of when we if we take it out of my my my flow, uh you can see that it's at at the core of it there's sort of this this prompt that we could take um and plug into chat GPT um, and often times in in when when I'm working with this I will also have an actual sketch of what I want and I sort of am then defining this in addition to the sketch.

### Live demo: generating a jacket from a prompt in ChatGPT

**7:52** · But just for the sake of us kind of playing in real time, um, I just thought it'd be cool to just, um, just use prompts to start with. So So here we have a sharply tailored waist defined jacket with exaggerated shoulders and blah blah blah, right? So now we're putting this in.

**8:11** · Oh, I should have told it to make an image, but maybe it'll figure out to do that. Yeah, there we go. Sometimes sometimes it's smarter than you think, even on instant. And so now it's going to generate an image and often times this will give me kind of like a product photo, but usually what I then want to do with this is to then take it to kind of the next level. And I'll have very specific types of like collateral that I want to get out of it. So once we have this ready, I will ask it to generate a Vogue style runway photo. Oh, there we go.

**8:43** · So this is kind of like the product photo of this. Um, so it has these exaggerated shoulders, uh, the waist, a lot of kind of the stuff that I asked it to. And if I had a specific sketch it would really adhere to my sketch much more so than than what was in the prompt. But then if we go to, um, here we say, oh, like now make it into a Vogue style Can you tell that I normally do not type anymore? And so I usually just use voice for all these things.

**9:13** · So it's just like so hard.

**9:16** · It's easier for our podcast guests, um, when you use voice because they don't have to imagine what you're typing. So she's, you know, you're typing make it into a Vogue style photo.

**9:27** · a photo model walking down the runway in this outfit. And so then I kind of just like iterate on this, and there's um, I go to to photo that's a runway photo, then I go to like influencer photo, and you kind of see this in a lot of from a lot of different angles, and also iterate on it based on kind of what you're seeing.

**9:51** · They'll make it, you know, red, make it shorter, make it longer, and all those different things, but I usually just start from from a specific point and then iterate from there.

### Why Image Gen 2.0 beats other models

**10:02** · I have a question for you, which is why Chat GPT and why Image Gen 2 as the as the model you're using? There's a lot of Image Gen models out there.

**10:13** · Why that particular one?

**10:15** · Yeah, so I've done a lot of experimentation with lots and lots of different image models, and what I found was ultimately Nano Banana and Image 2.0, really Image good at this.

**10:31** · Are the best at following visual directions. And often I'm not doing this, usually I'm sort of as I mentioned, I'm mostly giving them a physical like a sketch that I want them to turn into a picture, and what Image 1.5 did better than Nano Banana and Image Images Chat GPT Images 2.0 does even better is it really well follows the sketch.

**10:56** · In fact, it follows the sketch sometimes a little bit too precisely, and so you get something that doesn't look like fabric anymore, and you have to kind of be like, "No, no, no, no, no. You got to like it's got to flow." Like this is kind of why I have this this very detailed kind of prompting where I tell it how the fabric should flow because otherwise it can get into the mindset of, "Oh, she really wants it to look like paper." You know.

**11:19** · \[laughter\] But but the flip side though with all the other image models that I've tried is that they will make it look beautiful and realistic, but it will look very, very different from my design. And obviously when you're designing fashion, you you need it to look new and different. You don't need it to look like the most similar thing that's walked a runway some other time. And that's usually what you get with a lot of other image models.

**11:43** · What I love and if you can go back to your prompt flow, what I love about this is this is just Okay, so people are going to be like, "I'm not a fashion designer. I don't have any use for this." What I think is the takeaway here generally for folks is write down your process and write down what a definition of complete or good is. You you and I like you we're product ladies.

### The “prompt as spec” principle

**12:04** · I've product people. Yeah, it's a spec.

**12:06** · We're product people. We're like official product ladies. And you need a spec. Like your prompt is a spec. And so if you can put in to the effort of saying like, "What makes a really good garment? Like what makes a really good photo? What makes a really good illustration?" And come up with like five things that you can define for the prompt, you can get a really good output of AI. And then what I love, my friend says, "What's good for AI is good for humans." Like let's just say you had you were going to have a human sketch this out or build this.

**12:37** · This is the exact information they would need as well to do a good job. And so whether or not you're doing like fashion illustrations or coding, right? Like this at the spec the PRD matters, people. Like the spec matters. And so getting forcing yourself to sit down and be a little bit more precise is going to get you that exact outcome that you that you want.

**13:00** · And um you know, to be honest, I think that jacket's pretty pretty rad. I would I'd wear it.

**13:05** · This episode is brought to you by Jira by Atlassian. The teamwork graph in Jira delivers 44% more accurate agent results with 48% less token usage. That's a huge difference when working with AI coding agents like Claude, Cursor, Codex, or Copilot. The hardest part of shipping with AI isn't the code, it's the context. What's the right ticket? What did the spec say? What got decided in Slack?

**13:31** · The Teamwork graph pulls all of that from across your entire stack, from Jira and Confluence to GitHub, and feeds it directly to your agents before they write a single line. You assign the work, the agent \[music\] gets everything it needs, and a PR surfaces when it's ready. No digging, no context switching, no broken flow. Same team, smarter agents. Try and free at jira.dev. That's j i r a .d e v.

### Iterating the design

**14:03** · I love it. So, you've created this this image. I I I also love this idea taking like a core image and iterating it through like runway photo, influencer photo, like you know, stand-alone catalog like photo product product shot. What do you do next? Like, what's the next part of your flow?

**14:22** · So, a lot of what I do is um kind of iterate on it. And so, I I have this like, you know, change the color, change the you know, change the fabric. Um and so, I I have I have kind of a lot of these different ways to do that. But then, the next piece really comes to kind of like, what is the production process? And the production process is going to be very different depending on what I'm doing.

**14:47** · And so, um to give you an idea from one of these.

**14:52** · So, for example, I had this uh dress that actually did not come from a sketch. It came from I had this one day where I was just being bombarded with Ruth Asawa's um artwork in different places. Like, I went to I went with my son to this like like kids event, and there was an exhibit across the street that I like accident- like, we were just early, so we went and watched it. And we're like, "Oh, there's a flower model. There's like a permanent exhibit there."

**15:18** · Uh he had a piano recital and and the church had one of her pieces hanging like literally almost above my head and I was like, I keep I don't know. And so this was this is literally from my photos. I didn't have a sketch, right? Normally I start with a sketch, but in this case I was like you know, make a photo of a model walking down the runway in a dress inspired by Ruth Ruth Asawa's loop wire sculptures.

**15:43** · And it was important to that it had a beige undergarment because otherwise ChatGPT will not like it's like no, you're trying to make me make nude pictures and I don't do that.

**15:56** · \[laughter\] Very artistic nude picture.

**15:59** · No, I don't do that.

**16:01** · Um actually I think I think even here I tried to make it to remove the sculptures in the background and then it was like, we're sorry, this violates our nudity guidelines, right? This is like happens all the time. It's very \[laughter\] frustrating.

**16:13** · Quick side You know what? If I showed up to a date with my husband in this gown, I do not think he would be thrilled. I don't think he'd be like, ooh. It's not quite not quite the erotic gown.

**16:24** · It's like it's not Exactly, it's not it's not it's not nudity. It's not, you know, it's not porn. Um but but here we are. And so so this one, right? Like this is and I think that's um a lot of garments you would do like some some garments I will drape, right? Like on on on the on the model behind me or some some garments go into they become you create a kind of a pattern and I have different some some AI processes and some non-AI processes that I've done for patterns.

**16:55** · But this garment is previously unmanufacturable.

**17:01** · And so what I and I and I ended up kind of taking this and and also creating a video of it. This is this is kind of like you can you can see a little bit more of of how what it looks like. But the next step for this this particular garment will be to take it and 3D printed. And the particularly these kind of big ball pieces will need to be um 3D printed.

### Using Codex and computer use to build CAD files in 3D software

**17:27** · And so I uh then went on to Codex and had it help me create CAD uh files for these balls. I first prepped it and had it like I was like, "Okay, so I made made that into a sketch." Then I made these pieces into uh into kind of more sketch illustrations. Then I it didn't do well. It still didn't do well. We had a bunch of back and forth.

**18:00** · Eventually it started doing something that was a little bit more similar. Um I had to do This is a really really long process. And then ultimately I had it using uh computer use um go and build this in 3D software so that I could create like an additional file and send send off uh to 3D print. So that's the process for this particular garment to sort of to to 3D print it.

**18:22** · I have to again, like I have to pause because if if we're just talking about the creative like generation process, again, this is now a garment that would have been previously like almost inconceivable to make. Not just because it was it's difficult to construct, but even if you were like, "Of course we could 3D we could 3D print that before AI. We could 3D after AI."

**18:45** · The like tedium of creating the CAD models was so onerous that like even getting to the point where you could execute on it is is really hard. And so I just think this moment of like unlocking the previously impossible, whether the impossible was technically impossible or if it was just like practically infeasible, is is super important. The other thing um that I love bless computer use and like Codex plus computer use.

**19:17** · Love you so much because I can just be like I don't need to know how to use this software. Like you go use that software. You do whatever you want. Um I've gone through this like trough of despair of like SAS is dead.

**19:31** · Maybe like we're never going to touch a website again. Do you know what? Like agents are really good at pressing buttons. So like a software is back for but agents are going to use it. It's very very kind of like interesting shift I'm seeing.

**19:43** · I think that that's a great point and one one fascinating piece is that a lot of these things like for actual end product like a CAD file um Codex as amazing as it is um is not great at generating a final CAD file if you ask it to do it on its own. But if you use um yeah, if you use computer use uh and have it go and do it in a piece of software that's designed for that purpose.

**20:09** · I have both for like actually for 3D printing and there's a there's a fashion um uh software called Clo um that I've used as well and it generates this like like it generates patterns and it and it then fits them on a 3D model and and I tell Codex to go and use the software that I haven't learned how to use myself. And it does such a great job at something that it itself couldn't do. So it's sort of like SAS in combination with Yep.

**20:37** · Codex works so well on a lot of these things that uh that don't and I'm sure it's just a matter of time but that's that's where we are today. And I want to do it today. I don't want to wait. I don't want to wait like a year. Yeah.

**20:49** · I I love it so much. Okay, so you like generated an idea. We've sketched it. We've created images. We've even started to prototype the construction of it.

### Vendor research, outreach emails, and Superhuman browser use

**20:58** · How are you getting something built? And maybe not the gown. Like maybe this like keyboard shirt that you're wearing. Like how are we actually getting this manufactured?

**21:08** · Yeah.

**21:08** · So, for something like that, um what I've done, and I do this a lot, is I will go and now uh now this same tool is becomes my research assistant, and I ask it to identify like um you know, find 10 US-based custom apparel manufacturing companies that are similar to the one that I liked, but I want to see if there's other ones.

**21:33** · And then I just like there's a bunch of things I want, and I kick off a deep research uh extra high, so that it's extra high while doing it in that in that way. Um and um and then and then I get back a bunch of things, but usually so so for for a lot of my work, I end up like I'm doing something else. So, I'm like I am kicking off this research, and then I go and like drape fabric on on model, or I do like I'm I'm on my sewing machine doing prototypes.

**22:04** · Like I'm doing something else. And so, a lot of them kind of the next steps end up being via voice. And so, I like in this case I came back to and I was like, "Well, do you see the um because I'm talking uh apparel and using voice, right? Like the apparel manufacturers that I asked you to find, um now can you like put together the email that I can see that you can send off to them, but like you may want to make sure that you get my my approval to do that."

**22:31** · And then I have And then I use browser uh used to let it go into superhuman and like set all of these up for me, but I really want to click the send button before \[laughter\] Just to check its work.

**22:46** · Again, like something that is just so tedious, and you know, if if I was like you're you're you're much more diligent at this than I am, but if I was like, "Oh my gosh, I have this vision.

**22:56** · We're going to make We're going to make these keyboard shirts. They're going to be amazing." And then I'd be like, "How can I make it?" And then I'd be like, "Uh I have to like look up vendors. I would just practically give up because it feels so boring. But, if you can if you can get that work off to someone again like the next step and the next step and the next step, and then what you're going to end up with is this like incredible business.

**23:15** · And so, I just am like so inspired by people like you that take AI and create like a a niche and like can can then take that and build out a business where maybe one wouldn't wouldn't have been available or possible before. Um, I just think it's is is super cool. Okay, so you're doing this vendor outreach. You're actually going to get this thing this thing produced. Side note for all the cool girls out there.

### Building the full e-commerce site

**23:44** · Um, when they're ready, we all want one. Put me on that Put me on the pre-order pre-order There actually is. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to be that person, but you can pre-order it.

**23:53** · \[laughter\] Amazing. Perfect. Okay, and then last kind of kind of flow you have is like again going back to like pre-orders and how to actually run this business.

**24:04** · How are you using it to like be your technical co-founder in all this?

**24:08** · That's I I I got to say that that's probably like my favorite piece because this I mean, apart from the fact that it is like I have so much AI in this, but it's basically like an AI native like Everlane or something, right? Like normally I would hire like a technical team like engineers. I would have possibly have it I probably I probably wouldn't Let's be real. I wouldn't have a technical co-founder, but like I could have had a technical co-founder. I'm a solo solo founder girl. Like that is just my my my nature.

**24:38** · It's the life.

**24:40** · It's the life. But, but I would hire engineers. And um And I I I didn't, right? Like I I I had to build this website um and and I did it and I sort of just came to Codex and asked it to build the website. There's a lot of pieces here that that aren't just like a static website in that it like

**25:01** · you can you can obviously pre-order things that I could like add Stripe to it, which is like in prior lives I've been like a tedious big exercise, but I can go back and kind of show you the Stripe flow, but adding that was just like you know, a second. Um I had to create like databases to be able to like track votes as people are voting on these different garments. Um so I can decide kind of figure out like which are the most popular ones to bring to life. And so like I I had to do that.

**25:29** · Um In in the earlier phase of this, I had to create a separate dashboard for me to track the votes in real time. Um and so I did that. Now I really just like I just use voice and I'm like, "Oh hey, um how many votes do I have for this thing now, right?" So like why would I even have a dashboard?

**25:49** · \[laughter\] Um So I don't do that. But like just to kind of show you like Stripe flow as as as an example of of like, "Yeah, I I came here and I was like, 'Oh yeah, use browser to add Stripe to my site.'" It was like, "Uh I don't know. You're like, 'I'm not signed in.'" I'm like, "No, you got to sign in in my in my own in app browser." I'm like, "No, I don't know.

**26:12** · You got go to mine. I'm already signed up there." And then I was like, "Yeah, you got to do it." I'm like, "No, you can do it."

**26:17** · \[laughter\] You know, I was just like not going to go forward. It's like, "No, no, you can do it." Um and and yeah, this is it. And and then I had done.

**26:26** · Um Everything's uh added in and now pre-order's live. This is like a very very fast process. I'm literally whenever I like need to change something about like the the process, I can I can really just come here and it's just like list out all the things I want to I want to change and and it goes off and it finds the result project and um it's it has like finds uh the repository in GitHub and does all the things.

**26:54** · I would say like this weekend my son built his own websites with using like chat GPT sites and I'm sort of just like sitting there going like do I should I really like do I want to migrate off of her cell? Do I really want like you know, like if this is this a whole new like now like now a 9-year-old can have his technical co-founder like do this and like build build a company for him, right? Like just it's it's just so cool to see this all uh evolves, you know.

**27:25** · Your your 9-year-old and my 9-year-old are going to be best buds. We can create like a like a Codex club for fourth graders. \[laughter\] We should totally do that.

**27:35** · Um, this is a very sorry we are doing San Francisco Silicon Valley mommy stuff right now. I just want to I want to like go back to one thing because ripped from the headlines Codex prompting. I too am like hey Codex do this thing and it's like nah, no thanks. I can't. And I'm like no, I'm pretty sure you can. And then like after two like I'm pretty sure you can. It's like you're right. I can.

### Quick recap and what’s still hard

**27:59** · I am I'm going to post about this later but I have this like smart light bulb. You can see it's on my on my thing. And I was like hack it. And it was like no, I really shouldn't. I was like you can do it. And I was like done.

**28:09** · \[laughter\] So just a little bit insistent.

**28:15** · You know, and and you can get get stuff done.

**28:18** · This has been so so fun. Again, just like recapping for folks. A business that I think like would probably be inconceivable before AI fully stacked from the creative process creating images creating videos imagining product ideas all the way through like hardcore manufacturing and sourcing vendors to just like being able to voice note your virtual CTO and update anything you need to do and have your engineering team on demand in chat GPT. Pretty incredible.

**28:46** · I want to get through some lightning round questions and then we're going to get get you out of here. You know, my first question for you is like, what is the hardest part of this? Like, what is still Maybe like, what is still hard?

**29:00** · What isn't solved? What Where are you still feeling friction?

**29:03** · So, I'd say it's kind of two things. One is that like getting getting it to really do getting image models to do really unique things per your vision while still making it realistic. That it that has been really really hard. I feel like I've solved it. Like, I've kind of cracked that nut, but it still is and every now and again I'm sort of still get something that is really two-dimensional or whatever and I have to really refine it. Um the other piece that is still unsolved and I'm sort of still banging my head head against the wall is to get it to create patterns.

**29:37** · So, to get uh get it to create like actually accurate patterns based on my design.

**29:43** · And there I'm kind of running humans and AI in parallel. So, I I am working with human pattern makers and uh and Codex and just saying, "Who's going to get to like making my thing fastest like most accurate that like to my vision, you know?"

**29:58** · Um and so, that's uh that's been really cool to see. I'm not I'm not there yet with either actually with either uh flow. So.

**30:04** · Okay.

**30:04** · I love it. All right. And then my last question that I ask everybody speaking of like when it's hard and when it fails you and not getting there quite yet, which is how do you prompt AI when it's not working? What's your Are you nice Are you nice mom or a mean mom?

### How Yana prompts when AI pushes back

**30:21** · I can be both, but I I think I'm mostly a nice mom. Uh and and the reason is that I find that I get better outputs. So, like I mean, I am very direct and I'm sort of like, "Yes, you can."

**30:34** · Uh you know, you go do that. Like, I'm not just like, "Oh, yeah, I'm going to do this for you." Um but I'm I I be like very polite. I will still say please and thank you. Um and I do think that it's because like the the it's it's trained on body of text. And so if it sees for text output that is like rude and mean, it will like kind of get in the mind frame of that part of the internet, right?

**31:02** · Like versus like kind of more professional business context and then it will deliver something that's a little bit more what I want it to be. So that's But I I do it for selfish reasons. It's not because I'm afraid of the future AI overlords.

### Where to find Yana and how to vote on her garments

**31:16** · \[laughter\] Perfect. Well, this has been super super fun and inspirational and just like a breath of fresh air in terms of a new use case, a creative space that we haven't seen before and something sort of like manifesting the world. So where can we find you and how can we be helpful to you?

**31:32** · You can find me on X mostly. I am YanaBana on X. I am now YanaBana at X.

**31:39** · Um I I changed my handle too much to brand. Um but uh but yeah, the in in terms of just like helpfulness is getting feedback on all the stuff. Like you can come you can come to YanaBana and like vote on the garments that you like um so I can get feedback on like what's what's working for people and what's not. Like I'm all about user feedback and customer input.

**32:03** · Um and yeah, uh tell me tell me what you like.

**32:06** · I love it. Well, I love Poppy love. Let's smash that like button. It is very cool.

**32:13** · Awesome. Thank you. I will uh I'll let you know when that one is ready to available for purchase. Perfect. Well, thank you so much for joining How I AI.
