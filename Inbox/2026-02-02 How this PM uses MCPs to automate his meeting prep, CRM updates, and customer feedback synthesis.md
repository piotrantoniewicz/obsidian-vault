### Wprowadzenie do Reida Robinsona i jego roli w Zapier

**0:00** · MCPS, I will say it's a concept that's really hard to understand for folks.

**0:05** · Yeah, definitely don't think about the word. It really just is like app integrations for your AI tools. You can create these collections of tools from all the apps you use and give them access to Claude to Chatbt to Cursor, all the places that have inputs for MCP servers today.

**0:20** · I use agents all the time, but it is hard to break that muscle memory of this is a deterministic workflow versus an instructive agent. even if it has access to the same tools and can do the same things.

**0:33** · And when it comes down to it, the two things we see people wanting to do is one, giving their favorite AI tool the access to knowledge that lives in their apps as well as giving them the ability to actually do things in those apps.

**0:45** · Those are the two things that if that sounds like something that you need in an AI app you use, look for MCP or connectors as it's often being called now as well for that.

**0:56** · \[music\] Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claire Vo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today I'm talking to Reed Robinson, product manager on AI at Zapier. And what I love about my conversation with Reed is he's going to show us how to put MCPs to work inside Claude to take over tasks that you really hate.

**1:19** · We also talk about whether AI can be the perfect always on team that works while you sleep and some use cases to make your kids and your partner a little happier. Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by work OS. \[music\] AI has already changed how we work. Tools are helping teams write better code, analyze customer data, and even handle support tickets \[music\] automatically. But there's a catch.

**1:45** · These tools only work well when they have deep access to company systems. Your co-pilot needs to see your entire codebase. Your chatbot needs to search across internal docs. And for enterprise buyers, that \[music\] raises serious security concerns. That's why these apps face intense IT scrutiny from day one.

**2:04** · To pass, they need secure authentication, access controls, audit logs, the whole suite of enterprise \[music\] features. Building all that from scratch, it's a massive lift. That's where Work OS comes in. Work OS gives you \[music\] drop-in APIs for enterprise features so your app can become enterprise ready and scale \[music\] up market faster. Think of it like Stripe for enterprise features. OpenAI, Perplexity, \[music\] and Cursor are already using work OS to move faster and meet enterprise demands.

**2:32** · Join them and hundreds of other industry leaders at workos.com. Start building today. Hey Reed, thanks for joining how I AI. Thanks for having me here, Claire. Excited to chat today.

### Zrozumienie MCP jako integracji aplikacji dla narzędzi AI

**2:47** · What I love about how you've described your role at Zapier, which I use all the time, I say is like loadbearing infrastructure over at Chat PRD, is you've you've worked your way into a role where you get to kind of like pick what you're working on next in in AI. And so I'd love to hear about what you're focused on and how that's actually impacted how you think some about some of your personal workflows.

**3:11** · Absolutely.

**3:11** · So yeah, the way I often describe my role is often like sisophist of AI at Zapier just pushing the rock up the hill wherever that rock may be and whatever the hill might be. Right now the thing I'm most excited about and where I'm choosing to spend a lot of my time working on AI is on our approach to MCPs. Uh so we've got you know a server approach but as well as what we're doing on the client side. you know, MCPs, I will say, uh, still, I think, un both kind of very hyped and underutilized by people.

**3:40** · Um, because I think it's a it's a concept that's really hard to understand for folks. So, I'd encourage our listeners and our watchers who are a little nervous about waiting into the world of MCPs to just really think about, you know, if I could give my favorite AI chat client or IDE or whatever access to a bunch of tools to do things for me, um, what would I want them to do and then go hunt for an MCP that that does that thing. And I think you have have built a product that has tried to abstract away some of that complexity for Zapier users at least.

### Jak podejście Zapiera do MCP działa z ponad 8000 aplikacji

**4:14** · Could you walk us through kind of a little bit of your approach there?

**4:17** · Yeah, absolutely. And I I think you said it really well. The two kind of use cases I give people to just like I don't know think about MCPS is Yeah, definitely don't think about the word.

**4:26** · It really just is like app integrations for your AI tools. And when it comes down to it, the two things we see people wanting to do is one giving their favorite AI tool access to knowledge that lives in their apps as well as giving them the ability to actually do things in those apps. So, it's really those are the two things that if like that sounds like something that you need in an AI app you use, look for MCP or connectors as it's often being called now as well uh for that. And yeah, the approach that Zapier took for anybody not familiar with Zapier.

**4:55** · Uh we're like uh one of the world's largest AI orchestration automation platforms. And what that really means on the MCP side is we've got 8,000 apps on Zapier that are like every SAS app you can imagine.

**5:08** · There's 30,000 searches and actions amongst that. And that's all exposed via Zapier MCP. So you can create these like collections of tools from all the apps you use and give them access to claude to chatbt to cursor to all the places that have kind of inputs for MCP servers today.

**5:28** · Do you mind pulling that up and just showing us a little bit of what that that looks like? And while you're pulling up your screen, I do bless you MCP framework provider. Um, but we gota work we got to work on the branding here. So I think your description is exactly right like app connectors for for your AI is such a simpler way for the everyday consumer to understand this.

**5:51** · Um, and so okay so you're showing us Zapier here for folks that are just listening and just can you walk through in oh you have 8,000 tools that or 8,000 apps you can add tools from. So this is your MCP server that you've added a custom set of tools that you're going to use pretty consistently either for a use case or just as a as an individual, right?

**6:13** · Yeah, exactly. And so the way that it works is I kind of set up the ones that I'm using specifically for Claude. Uh and so what's nice on Zapier side unlike many other MCP servers is we actually are more like a platform for creating servers. So you can create multiple and what that means is you can create specific sets of tools to use with claude or with a particular agent or with chatbt or with cursor uh really anything out there that supports it. Um, which is nice cuz for me those tools are different from one place to the other.

**6:45** · And yeah, you can see or for those who can't see, uh, you can add tools from things like Slack, Evernotes, Glean, Koda, Google Calendar, and you can actually start to customize those tools as well. Um so whether you want to like restrict them to using certain uh databases like I've done with Kod I for my use within claude I really I'm using it for particular documents and particular sheets for instance um and other sides like with Evernote I want to restrict it to writing to certain notebooks.

**7:16** · Uh so it really allows you to like customize the way you want your tool to work in different places. uh which is quite nice because then it's like a single URL to give over to Claude and connect to. And now if I switch over to Claude here, uh you can see that Claude now has like a single Zapier connector, but in that Zapier connector is like all of the different tools that I want Claude to be able to access.

**7:40** · Yeah.

**7:40** · Yeah. And one of the things that I'll call out for the sort of more advanced MCP users and a challenge that I've always had is when you're adding these individual MCP, like there's a Google calendar MCP and I'm sure there's a KOD MCP is when you're adding these individual ones, you kind of have to do that configuration at the provider level. Um, and what I like about this approach is like this custom collection of tools is actually a really nice way to think about the MCP tools that you need. Um, either just in general or for a specific use case.

**8:10** · And then for um, MCP clients out there, I just I think we're going to need at some point more and I know you're working on this, but like you just need more granular control over tools pri I mean like priority. I think of tool calling is really important. I have um two MCPs that I use really frequently in cursor and they're always like competing for which one I'm trying to call because I say it's like it's like search projects. Everything has projects in it. Always calls the wrong wrong MCP.

**8:41** · And so I do think like the the meta abstractions around MCPS are going to start being more important as they become more adopted. So that's Claire's uh manifesto on MCP MCP design. All right. So, you have this custom MCP.

**8:59** · I mean, what are specific things this unlocks for you? So, what use cases are are you using here to actually get more work done?

### Wykorzystanie Claude Projects do ulepszania instrukcji obsługi narzędzi

**9:08** · Yeah.

**9:08** · So, for me, there's like things that I don't love doing um is really where it helps me. Uh so, one like and for one of the things you just touched on, which is like the model's ability today to pick which tool is a bit murky. Um I think Claude is a phenomenal place. They've done a great job with tool calling. One of the tricks for anybody listening uh check out cloud projects.

**9:30** · Uh in particular, one of the things that you can do in cloud projects is provide very like detailed instructions for use cases. And so for instance, I'll show I'll share my screen here, but I have one that's all about the way I like logging and looking up data from CRM from our CRM for things. And I've actually told it like how it should use tools, in which order it should use tools, what data should go where when it's creating records in those with those tools.

**9:56** · And it when so then in Claude when I'm trying to do things, I can actually be like, oh, I'm doing a CRM thing. I'm actually going to go ahead and select my CRM project and then shoot over a message. And now Claude's ability to like execute across many different tools sequentially uh is so much better. Uh, so I'd highly recommend if anybody's like running into those things, try out projects. Um, highly recommend it.

**10:20** · Yeah, I've heard a lot of people talk about using cloud projects for knowledge, like loading it up with knowledge, but I haven't heard anybody talk about what you specifically gave as an example, which is use cloud projects to give specific instructions relative to MCP tool usage and a workflow. And so folks, listen up. You can do that in cloud projects um and probably other clients to just make your your use of your tools more efficient. Okay, so you have this cloud project. It looks like one of the things you hate doing is updating your CRM.

**10:50** · Um like like a true account.

**10:56** · \[laughter\] Um I I I do actually tell people um MCPs are highly underappreciated by customerf facing teams. Like what what do customerf facing teams hate doing?

**11:08** · updating Salesforce, we hate it. We hate it. And so like, you know, keeping good customer records, whether it's for a sales use case, a research use case, whatever, is like really tedious and they're actually amazing MCPs out there to do this. So, uh, I love to see how how this works in your flow.

**11:25** · Yeah, absolutely. So, we know first one of the first things I do is I have my daily planning one and that actually like goes through my full calendar and one of the nice things is I've given it access to like internal uh lookup tools.

**11:38** · So, for instance, when I run this, it can actually look up the person I'm meetings with, uh, Zapier usage, their company's Zapier usage, our past sales interaction with them, and it's able to like follow the process of doing all that lookup, and then when it comes back with ultimately my daily update, it has all of that research included. So, again, really one that I've helped a lot of our sales team uh, get set up with, and we've actually been like demoing it uh, when we go to like events. Uh, that's been pretty fun.

**12:04** · But yeah, on the CRM side, so let's say that I have the biggest one for me is actually my like postmeating notes management. Uh I I'm a big fan of Granola. They're a great tool. Uh but I struggle with the fact that sometimes I don't want to log those notes or I don't do it all the time. Um or it can just be really tedious to go about doing that.

### Zarządzanie notatkami po spotkaniach

**12:28** · And so one of the things that I found really helpful here is I can I have like a cloud project that has a bunch of instructions on just how to log this data, where should it log, and then I can go in and actually select that project. Um, and then what it can do is it should be a it'll have access to all the tools and it'll start like running it through uh for this. And now this one's going to be interesting because I'm I have the project configured to like our production database and it's going to try it with a different one.

**12:58** · So let's see if this works for that. But it should be checking against this kod document uh for things and seeing like what are the interviews I have scheduled and what are the things that are coming up. And if I go back to my little buddy claude here, it's going to tell me that sure enough nothing was found. Uh then it can choose to, you know, start doing additional things where I've taught it to like use our internal lookup to find this person's thing. Uh I'm going to skip this for now.

**13:28** · Don't want to pull in actual stuff here. And then some other things is glean. Like now I've given it an action uh as well to search like our internal Glean uh tool which is awesome because then I could see like oh well we talked about this customer in Slack or we had notes from the CSM on what this meeting's supposed to be about. So it helps do a lot of that. And then eventually what it gets into doing is start to say like, okay, this didn't exist. Here's what I looked up based on the notes from the meeting. Like, let me go create that and run with it.

**14:03** · And that updates your KOD with what?

**14:07** · Ah, so yeah, that updates the COD with like and this is I'm doing a demo in here for y'all. Um, essentially like the KOD that I do have is a lot of the times I work on some of our like new products or new features. I'm doing like customer research in these like smaller dedicated sprints. And so we typically will have something in KOD. I might also need to update our actual CRM which will use HubSpot as well. So I'd have that as like an additional tool to log it as an activity on the meeting. But for the most part, I'm making sure that I have a record of this meeting.

**14:37** · Uh who I met with, what if there were next steps, what were the next steps. Uh it'll include some details on like what is if there's a bigger opportunity, like what are the opportunity details. um you can really get it to include a lot of things. And I think that's where if I go back to the prompt for a second, uh things like this here where you'll see I t I kind of like I don't know our users always say they train the model.

**14:59** · So if that makes sense to you, you can train the model uh on how to populate your CRM fields because everybody's CRM fields are unique, right? Like nobody uses uh standard cookie cutter CRM for the most part. Um folks love their custom fields. Um, but models don't know what those custom fields are and what those choices are. So, great way again just to get it to be familiar with you and working specifically for you.

### Porównanie deterministycznych przepływów pracy z Instrukcje agenta

**15:26** · What I think is really interesting here again as like a power Zapier user is I have a similar flow which is I take granola transcripts. I use the granola um app in Zapier but I have mapped this out in the standard workflow builder.

**15:43** · So I have done the I think now that I'm seeing this the inefficient task of saying okay like if this look up this record if the record doesn't exist do that if the record does exist do this and so I have this like very similar CRM record updating flow in Zapier um but

**16:05** · it's very step-by-step kind of like deterministic workflow and what I like about this and I should be doing better because I'm supposed to be like fairy godmother of AI I you can actually just in natural language describe that flow and I know this I use agents all the time but it is hard to break that muscle memory of like this is a you know a deterministic workflow versus an instructive agent even if it has access to the same tools and can do the same things.

**16:37** · And so have you found that one one path or the other is more or less brittle? Meaning like is is this actually more resilient this sort of like MCP agentic instructions piece more resilient to the complexities of your data or do you find that it fails more or less than like kind of these nice uh netted out workflows?

**17:02** · Yeah, it's a very good question. I think the on the kind of reliability or where they fail, they're they've got their like pros and cons. The pros of doing things like asynchronously is certainly things can take longer. Uh like one of the biggest challenges right now with MCP stuff is they just they can't take that long. Um and so if you have like a lookup process that might take like seven minutes, like that's not going to work here. uh where that does you can start to do a lot more of that in like deterministic workflow land so to speak.

**17:37** · Um the other big thing though to be honest like the distinction that I that what it really boils down to cuz Zapier also has an agents product where you could do this as an agent thing but really what this boils down to is just giving the tools giving the knowledge and the ability to take actions to the all the AI apps where you use them.

**17:54** · It's kind of like the old product thing about like you know meeting your user where they are right uh right place right time and I have found that that is probably the biggest thing because there are so many times where I am you know like if

**18:10** · for anybody with keen eyes you would have saw one of the projects I have here is actually even like idea jammer I have a whole project dedic hooked up to different tables and stuff like that for myself when I'm just like jamming on a topic and it then will like research like have we explored similar ideas or where might this be relevant and it has more train more like uh prompting there to like challenge me and certain methodologies to challenge me on that.

### Pomysłowy jammer Reida

**18:37** · So, it really boils down to just like meeting people. And I'll be clear like one of the things we're seeing though from like enterprises that are that are adopting this is the fact that they're trying to make sure that these tools work for all of their employees like automatically so that if they've rolled out claw for the entire organization when they log in and they connect to appear it like has the tools that they should need for their role that it's created by some like ops admin or someone. Yeah.

**19:10** · Um, and that's been really powerful.

**19:12** · As an AI founder, you're used \[music\] to sprinting towards product market fit, your next round, or that first enterprise contract. But speed \[music\] isn't enough for AI startups. Buyers expect security, compliance, and transparency from day one. That's why serious AI startups use \[music\] Vanta.

**19:32** · With deep integrations and automated workflows built for fastm moving AI teams, Vanta gets you audit \[music\] ready fast and keeps you secure with continuous monitoring as your models, \[music\] infra, and customers evolve. AI innovators like Langchain, Writer, and Cursor \[music\] scaled faster and closed bigger deals by getting security right early with Vanta. \[music\] Listeners can claim a special offer of $1,000 off Vanta at vanta.comhowi.

### Budowanie przepływu pracy przygotowującego do wywiadu z klientem

**20:04** · There are pros and cons to each. You know, you mentioned three different methodologies. There's MCPs put in like the client where you're actually working. There's agents which do some of this and like sort of a native client.

**20:16** · Then there's these deterministic workflows and you do have a workflow that does use AI within a more deterministic flow. So do you want to walk us through through that one and just talk about why you selected this kind of model of implementation for this particular use case?

**20:33** · Yeah, absolutely. So one of the things for me again I like prep for a lot of customer interviews and we have a lot of data and sometimes one of the most embarrassing things for me or it feels embarrassing is when I get on a call with a customer and they're like just a user interview that may have booked it via LinkedIn. They may have booked it via a referral from someone at a partner, right? Like they come in from all over the place. Like my Calendarly link seems to like spread um decently wide.

**21:00** · And sometimes I'll get on a call previously and I'd be like, I don't know who you are. I don't know if your company uses Zappier. I don't know if they, you know, and sometimes they're like, oh yeah, we're both a customer and a uh partner, right? And I'm like, whoops. I didn't know that. Um and so what I and what I worked with and our salesfacing team had similar issues. And so one of the first things that we did was we used data bricks which houses like a lot of our data and makes that usable.

**21:30** · And so they built like this whole series of things that allows like just simple lookup for you know given an email address come back with like a whole write up of it. And so essentially this is a fancy looking workflow. Uh but the gist of it is that forever the meetings that I'm having it goes out fetches that like research lookup which takes time and then it deciphers that

**21:56** · into a like it uses actually a Gemini step since it handles my like the the document type that I was working with and creates the or appends it technically to the KOD page for that customer interview. And so this is really helpful for me again because it's just like now when I'm going into my meetings, I get things like this where this is also where I'll like take some of my notes.

**22:20** · Um, and so I can actually see like, oh, how they did use it and get some really like crisp things uh to walk into the meeting knowing. And I think for anybody especially in bigger companies like one of the biggest challenges we consistently see is they just like they're using when they start to use AI they're using like the base models with like no additional context aheaded and so the unlocks for them

**22:46** · often become how do you get your whole sales team to not only like use AI to log things but also like fetch information from their CRM and from their data systems uh when and where they need it. Um, and that becomes really cool because, you know, technically I could then throw like data bricks lookups into an MCP tool and put that to claude. Um, gets really funky. Uh, those typically take too long though.

### Wykorzystanie Gemini do przetwarzania danych opartych na plikach

**23:10** · Yeah.

**23:10** · Well, if you are uh the AI sophist, one of the things I might recommend and I think you probably would as well is you like buddy buddy buddy up to the data engineering team. That's for sure. Um, because that's a really useful source of interesting rich information.

**23:26** · And then one other thing I want to call out that may have zipped by people, especially those that are listening, is if you go into your user context zap that you just showed us, you chose Google Gemini. And I just want to reiterate why. Um, because I've heard this a lot from different different guests, which is the Google models in particular are just like great at files.

**23:46** · They love a file. They're it's it's great at files. So Gemini um really good at large files, files, context, video files, audio files. And so anytime you have sort of like a filebased um challenge ahead of you or or use case, I see a lot of um AI power users reaching for the Gemini models, is that what drove this particular use case?

**24:09** · Yep, you nailed it.

**24:11** · Um yeah, the output from our data team is actually to date a PDF.

**24:15** · Um and so it works very well. um with that actually it's HTML that was the what so I convert the HTML to a file because then it works really really well um and a lot less tokens which is nice yeah I mean it's interesting the ascendancy of the markdown file for you

**24:33** · know the open AAI and anthropic models or chat GPT and claude and I do think Gemini has taken this like side angle where it's like you know you but if you have a PDF or if you have some other file format where where where your model so I I think it's really interesting for folks who want to go to the next level of implementation.

**24:48** · Again, to not only feed rich context into their AI use cases, but also really understand a couple of the highle nuances of the major commercial models, so you're picking the right one because I I would guess you'd get a worse output with a with a different model just because of the the data input. Okay, that is super super useful. And then um so you've talked a lot about customer interactions, right? CRM updates, meetings, but you also get a lot of asynchronous customer feedback.

### Tworzenie pozytywnego cyklu analizy opinii klientów

**25:17** · Um, including from me and shout out, uh, whoever is on the receiving end of my support and product feedback tickets.

**25:28** · Thank you. I appreciate you. You're always really, really responsive. How do you drive that responsiveness using AI or systematically across a pretty large customer footprint?

**25:38** · Yeah, it's fun. Um there's a lot of things I I'll walk through one of the things I have found impactful especially with like our newer products that we're pushing out. Um one thing I'll say I I can't show this but again does work with data and getting better relationships with data engineering. Um I think when we've started to like unlock more and more capabilities with with data on that front as well.

**26:01** · Uh like with MCP just this week our team got to the point where we're now properly like analyzing a lot of feedback and actually creating uh pages in KOD for review uh for things for our team as we walk in based on like new trends that are emerging amongst the data uh automatically uh which is quite fun. But one of the things that we've also done here that really helps is just like making it more searchable for folks.

**26:28** · Uh this is really helpful for like not even the core build team that's working on the product, but when I'm working with uh for instance like sales or I'm working with PMM uh that are supporting us with launches, they'll often have questions of like, hey, what feedback have we been receiving lately?

**26:45** · Or like are people doing this sort of use case? Right? and they're just they have very specific questions or they're trying to understand something. Um or it's the designer who as we're diving into a topic, we want to like really quickly surface uh times where users have had uh issues with the like error log system and they want to like find like hey can we find that?

**27:04** · And so created like a little chatbot here uh that essentially just like it's really simple but it it is fed with a bunch of like databases essentially and then just like makes that really easily searchable right um it's a standard chatbot rag type thing I won't go into it um in much detail but it's like internally locked down for us um and all those things which is really helpful um and and we

**27:32** · also use this sort of system externally as well so like you'll And one of the things that we do here is I have our MCP helper chatbot transcripts. And so I have this kind of like enduserfacing chatbot. And you'll see it it has these like knowledge sources which are basically just like our help docs as well as one uh table which is like a Google sheet type thing. It's our sappier world of that. And I I love this little system and I'll just talk for a second.

**27:58** · Uh and it's really just you know for anybody that's working with data and knowledge management things. it's difficult to keep it up to date and I found myself previously constantly like trying to go back to our knowledge sources that these these bots had and just like trying to manually keep it up to date on like a monthly or quarterly basis.

**28:16** · Uh but one system I ended up finding that worked really well for me is I built um like one there's a zap somewhere that essentially every time there is a closed uh support ticket or if there's a a finished chatbot transcript it analyzes the conversation

**28:33** · and tries to say like what is the core FAQ from this like what was the core issue what was the solution if any and is that already in the knowledge base that we had if not please propose an entry and so what I then do is I have my like human step here where I can actually review the FAQs that it wants to submit and all I have to do to I can edit it as well like what the answer is and if I approve it it goes over to a different database which is the one that the bot is actually using.

**29:01** · Um so a really nice way that I have found consistently now on a number of projects just to like rapidly iterate and keep those things up to date so that users are just getting like their answers faster. Uh which is really nice. Yeah.

### Ramy „gdybyś mógł uruchomić ChatGPT przez sen”

**29:17** · Well, what what I like about this is I often tell people who are trying to figure out use cases of AI or implement AI solutions is they really get stuck on like the I'm doing X. How do I use AI to continue to do X or do X faster, whatever? And that's fine. I think that's a like I I I'm already taking meetings. How do I make taking those meetings a little easier? But the challenge I often give people is let's say you had the perfect team with infinite time.

**29:44** · What are the things your perfect team with infinite time would do in anyone's and your perfect support team with infinite time would look at every support question and would go see do we have the right help desk content here and if we don't let's write great content and then let's publish it and then let's put that in the chat like in an ideal but none of us live in ideal worlds we're super busy and so I think this is like a really good example of that where it allows you to operate at a

**30:16** · next level of quality, not just like velocity, but a next level of quality.

**30:21** · And then again, like the more highquality data you create, the more you can power interesting AI solutions to your customers like chat bots. And so, um, you know, again, anybody out there looking like if I had a full-fledged team of SDRs that were perfect and had infinite time, what would I do? Or like, you know, 10,000 support people with infinite time, what would I do? like start to think about those use cases and don't forget to to pluck those off because I think they can unlock some interesting ideas inside your team and then let your team act as higher leverage folks.

**30:53** · I like the way you put that. The the other I don't know if it helps ever to anybody, but the other way I often tell folks that are struggling with that is like if you could run chatbt in your sleep, what would you do is you know I found a really good way to help people start brainstorming ideas. I will say as like a maybe aside on that on the product design world, uh we found we did one experiment really early on um that

**31:18** · was kind of like Mad Libs to help discover use cases and stuff and it was a very interesting experiment in that it seemed to actually help people discover what they wanted to do but it also challenged them to think through like what their pain points were and it was really fascinating uh just to to experience. So, uh, for anybody looking at that in their products, try a Mad Libs style, uh, AI enabled system to like ask questions and ask follow-up questions with free form text.

### Krótkie podsumowanie

**31:48** · Just to kind of take a step back and walk through what you what you showed us today, we have MCPs. Um, Zapier MCPS in particular can give you a really custom set of tools to call. You like Claude, you like using Claude projects to give instructions on tool calling sequence and instructions so you get really high quality outputs of that. And then you're really focused on um I heard you say very early on in the episode avoiding things you hate which is like all of us updating the CRM.

**32:18** · Um you know attending what we all attend which are just in time meetings, right? you just get out of the next meeting and you you show up in the next one without context. So, making sure you're prepped for that. And then kind of this virtuous cycle of customer feedback, support feedback, FAQs, um you know, internal input, and then customerf facing uh help content as kind of a a happy happy circle here.

**32:44** · And so, I think this is great for anybody who's spending a lot of time with customers, whether you're in sales or support or product. um to be better prepared um and and get stuff done with less tabs open in your browser, which is what we all want.

### Osobiste przypadki użycia

**33:04** · Well, uh Reed, I'm going to we're going to do a couple lightning round questions and then we'll get you out of here back to um pushing the boulder up the hill.

**33:12** · My first question for you is we've seen a lot of business use cases. What are like your favorite personal use cases?

**33:18** · like what are ones that have really surprised you either by making you know really how sparking joy or just really solving a problem personally?

**33:27** · Yeah, I'll touch on two real fast.

**33:30** · Number \[clears throat\] one, in terms of solving a problem, family calendar planning. Uh for anybody that has kids and families, like family calendar, it's a real thing. Um and for me, the struggle is uh my my wife and I both like a physical calendar in the house and we're reluctant to get like a full digital frame thing. Um, so we have a physical one that we write things on, but I like live by Google calendar. And if it's really not my Google calendar, it like doesn't exist. Um, and particularly if it's a family event that's in the middle of the like a normal day, then someone can book a meeting over and that's really not good.

**34:03** · And so I actually have a claw project called family calendar. It has really detailed instructions on it's not too detailed but it basically tells it like which calendar to look at uh how to add things if it's an event that's at my son's school or somewhere to leave time in my calendar to drive there and drive back if it's you know during the business hours. Uh so that that is blocked.

**34:24** · And now what I do is like occasionally I just take a picture of the physical calendar and then it uses the various like find and update and create actions for Google calendar through Zapium MTP and just like does all of it. Um and I love that. Um that's probably like one of the greatest things. Uh other than that these days uh they had a big V5 update recently. I have been loving it with my son and his other like friends in our neighborhood.

**34:50** · Uh we've made a lot of songs together. I literally just like talked to Claude and I was like, "Hey Claude, you're gonna write a kid song for my son Leo. He's four. Here's what we did today." And I just like told it what we did. And my son insisted that it have poop and fart jokes in it as well. And so I was like, "Well, you need to have some poop and fart jokes." Um, and my son has listened to this at least on Suno alone 14 times.

**35:17** · Uh we gave it to one of his babysitters and she they listen to together like non-stop for an hour. Um and we've done this with like his friends and they've made songs for each other and it's really fun and it's the other thing too is like some of the older kids nearby like uh one of the girls like 10 almost 10 and she's been learning about like prompting through this because she was like oh it said this but like that's not right. I and I was like well you got to be specific in this and you got to like instruct it. And so I have I gave them like a a whiteboard with a dry erase marker and they're just like writing out their little prompts. Um and then I input them for them.

**35:49** · Um and so that's been a lot of fun and I think I don't know hopefully a little bit educational.

**35:55** · I have to I have to just uh bring us back to our starter topic which is does Sunno have an MCP?

**36:03** · That's good.

**36:04** · Team I I am also a uh extreme Puno power user. Love it. And imagine imagine you could take your customer prep meeting and just give yourself like a friendly jingle to remember what they're talking.

**36:17** · You laugh. But I've actually I did that with I took our I took our MCP sales training session. I actually took the transcript from Zoom along with the deck and I gave it to Claude and I said come up with a pop song I think for this and I've actually shared it and a couple of our like sales team and product team have actually listened to it and really liked it. Um I mean yeah we we teach kids with music and humans have been I don't know music people much longer than we've been reading people.

**36:47** · Um so it's it's fun uh to explore that. I might I might have you beat which is I took a incident postmortem for like an engineering incident and then made it was like a punk song about how we needed to solve the root cause issues. Um and it was called Renew theerts. It was it's a very it's a b it's a b certified banger. So um we'll have to put a playlist together and put it in the show notes. Okay. And then there's one last use case which I love.

### Wykorzystanie Notebook AI do przygotowania spersonalizowanych rozmów kwalifikacyjnych

**37:18** · I want to make sure we spend a couple minutes on it with notebook LM.

**37:22** · Yeah, this one I I think Notebook LM I use personally for learning. Uh, I put like a lot of things in it to learn, but I got one that I got a lot of value from, uh, and a lot of brownie I bonus husband points from with my wife. Uh, which was she was recently like job searching. And what I did for her on all of them was like when she got the interview, I would take their like careers page. I would take the job thing. I would find like more information. And I had like a prompt I used for the audio overview that was like, "You are preparing Anna for this interview.

**37:52** · Like make sure it's specific to Anna." and she listened to all of these before and she like constantly got feedback throughout the process that she was like the most informed applicant.

**38:02** · She clearly understood the space cuz I, you know, would always tell like talk about the competitors, what they're doing in the marketing world and what are trends going on there. Um, and she loved that it was also like so Anna, we're going to prepare you today. It was really cute. Um, but it worked exceptionally well for her. um she ended up getting like the ideal job that she really wanted. Um and yeah, it was pretty awesome. So, highly recommend that. It's also great bonus points for anybody out there with friends, family, interviewing, um the ways that you can really help them.

**38:35** · Okay, I'm going to have to make hats, which is like my love language is personalized AI podcasts. It's very good. It's very good.

Tell me what you wish existed. Um, I also love hearing from the folks who are thinking about the future of all of this. Um, who've tried like wacky things and they're like, "Hey, if only I could do this." Um, I'd love that. like bigger picture thinking stuff as well.
